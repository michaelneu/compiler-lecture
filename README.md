# Compiler Construction - Excercises

This repository contains the excercises from the compiler construction course at the OTH Regensburg. 

## Usage

The excercises are written in TypeScript, thus one needs to install the dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm` first:

```bash
$ cd compiler-lecture/
$ yarn install
```

To run the solution to a specific excercise, simply "start" it's source file:

```bash
# e.g. to start excercise 1d of the third excercise sheet, simply type
$ yarn start src/uebung3/1d.ts
```
